Specifically, the values to be converted to color are modified according to the log_scale and/or percent flags. This is also done to the values specified in an explicit continuous colors pallete.\n\nIn Plotly's API, a color pallete is always specified to cover the values between 0 and 1, and it linearly maps some range of colors to this unit range. You can control the mapping of the values to be colored by using color_axis to modify the values (log_scale, percent) and also specify the specific range of color values to map to the unit range (minimum, maximum).\n\nWhen specifying an explict continuous colors pallete, we must map its lowest value to 0 and the highest value to 1 (and the values must be in non-decreasing order).

We therefore have to copy their definition here. An upside of having this dictionary is that you are free to insert additional named palettes into and gain the convenience of refering to them by name (e.g., for coloring heatmap annotations).\n\nA _r suffix specifies reversing the order of the pallete.\n\nYou can also append a final _z:<value_fraction>:<color_fraction> suffix to the name. This will map values in the bottom 0..value_fraction of the range to white, and map the rest of the values to the top color_fraction..1 range of the palette. For example, Blues_z:0.3:0.2 will color the bottom 30% of the values in white, and color the top 70% of the values to the top 80% of the Blues pallete.\n\nA _c:<value_fraction>:<color_fraction> works similarly to the _z suffix, except that the fractions are centered on 0.5 (the middle) of the values and color ranges. This is meant to be applied when the values range is +/-Diff, and the pallete has white in the middle. For example RdBu_c:0.3:0.2 will color the 30% of the values near the 0 middle in white, and color the rest of the values using the top and bottom 40% of the RdBu pallete.\n\nAn _o:<value_fraction>:<color> suffix maps the pallete to the range 0..1-value_fraction, and all the values above this to the color, to denote overflow (too high) values. For example, Blues_o:0.01:magenta will color all the values in the bottom 99% of the values range to Blues, and the top 1% of the range to magenta. A _u suffix works similarly but applies to the bottom range of the values.\n\nYou can combine multiple suffixes together, for example Reds_z:0.2:0.2_o:0.99:magenta or RdBu_r_c:0.2:0.2_o:0.01:magenta_u:0.01:darkgreen.\n\nPalletes with suffixes (including _r) are computed on the fly and cached for future use.\n\nnote: Note\nThe implementation of the suffixes uses 1e-6 as a color difference \"too small to matter\". Don't use fractions this small in the prefixes or you will have a bad day.\n\nnote: Note\nAlways hold the COLOR_PALETTES_LOCK when manually accessing the NAMED_COLOR_PALETTES, otherwise you will regret it at some point.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"constant"},{"location":"common.html#SomeGraphs.Common.COLOR_PALETTES_LOCK","page":"Common","title":"SomeGraphs.Common.COLOR_PALETTES_LOCK","text":"A global lock to use when accessing the NAMED_COLOR_PALETTES.

Both objects need to be internally consistent, as does their combination. This is especially relevant for the graph configuration. When creating UI for filling in these objects, we can do limited validation of each field on its own based on its type (e.g. (e.g., ensure that a \"color\" field contains a valid color name). Some restrictions, however, are not easily deduced from the field type, or relate different fields to each other. Replicating all the restrictions in the UI is tedious and error prone.\n\nWe therefore provide a framework here for validating the objects and generate a hopefully informative error message if anything is wrong. This can be used by the UI to validate the data without worrying about the details.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"validations.html#SomeGraphs.Validations.Validated","page":"Validations","title":"SomeGraphs.Validations.Validated","text":"A common type for objects that support validation, that is, that one can invoke validate on.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"validations.html#SomeGraphs.Validations.ValidationContext","page":"Validations","title":"SomeGraphs.Validations.ValidationContext","text":"A context (path of field names and/or indices) leading to a validated value.
